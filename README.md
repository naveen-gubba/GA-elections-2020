# GA-elections-2020
My first data analytics code I used though to wade through a controversial but topical subject. Being neutral I wanted to uncover:
1. Is there a voting pattern between Urban and Rural population?
2. ï‚·Due to COVID was there a pattern in terms of voters exercising different modes of casting their votes? The different modes being election day voting, 
   absentee by mailing,advance voting
